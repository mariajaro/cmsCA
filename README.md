# Cross-course-Project | Rainydays

![logo](images/RainyDays_Logo.png)

This is my first project that we worked on during the first year at Noroff. We had to build a website for a brand that wanted to sell jackets for women and men that liked to be outisde. 

## Description

This is the first project we were awarded at Noroff. The project spanned two semesters and we were to work on improving the site. In the first draft, we were only going to use HTML and CSS. Gradually, when we gained more knowledge, we added JS to the project.

As of today (June 2023), the site is not 100 percent complete. This is something I will continue to build on.

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Getting Started

### Installing 

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mariajaro/cmsCA.git
```

### Running

This project contains only static files, so it will pretty much run on all devices. Just go into the root folder where you cloned this repo, and double click on index.html to run the file in your browser.

## Contributing

As this being a school project, it is not open for contributions.
